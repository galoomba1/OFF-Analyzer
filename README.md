Reads file named `input.off` in main folder

General rectification: after outputting the elements, write `r` and then the index of the edge type you want to use. It prints the list of vertices to `polytope_input.txt`.

General truncation: after outputting the elements, write `t` and then the index of the edge type you want to use. It prints the list of vertices to `polytope_input.txt`. Currently puts vertices at 1/4 and 3/4 of the edge by default, but it can be changed in the code.
